# Food Containers Detection & Tracking - Computer Vision Task

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting and tracking food containers in a dining hall. The goal is to monitor food consumption and refills using a video feed.

---

## **Approach**

### **Dataset**
We use the **COCO dataset** ([COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)), filtering it to include only the following classes:
- **Bowl**
- **Wine Glass**
- **Cup**
- **Bottle**

### **Model**
We use **YOLOv8n** for object detection because:
- It is **lightweight** and optimized for real-time processing.
- It provides a good balance between **accuracy** and **speed**.

### **Fine-Tuning**
The model is fine-tuned using **half of the COCO validation dataset** to avoid overfitting. Data augmentation techniques (brightness, contrast, noise, flips) are applied to improve robustness.

### **Training**
Training is done on a local machine using:
- **PyTorch** and **Ultralytics** for YOLOv8.
- **Adam optimizer** for efficient training.

### **Inference**
A test video (`video_containers_3.mp4`) is used to detect movements, disappearances, and refills of bowls. The model outputs timestamps for each event in **JSON format**.
